# ðŸ”¥ FEVER [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/DCSO/fever.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/DCSO/fever)

The Fast, Extensible, Versatile Event Router (FEVER) is a tool for fast processing of events from Suricata's JSON EVE output. What is meant by 'processing' is defined by a number of modular components, for example facilitating fast ingestion into a database. Other processors implement collection, aggregation and forwarding of various metadata (e.g. aggregated and raw flows, passive DNS data, etc.) as well as performance metrics.

It is meant to be used in front of (or as a replacement for) general-purpose log processors like Logstash to increase event throughput as observed on sensors that see a lot of traffic.

## Building

Like any good Go program:

```
$ go get -t ./...
$ go build ./...
$ go install -v ./...
...
$ fever run -h
```

## Usage

```
$ ./fever run -h
The 'run' command starts the FEVER service, consuming events from
the input and executing all processing components.

Usage:
  fever run [flags]

Global Flags:
      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.fever.yaml)
```

It is also possible to use a config file in YAML format ([Example](fever.yaml)). Configuration is cascading: first settings are loaded from the config file and can then be overridden by command line parameters.

## Running tests

The test suite requires a Redis executable in the current path. Most simply, this requirement can be satisfied by just installing Redis. For instance, via `apt`:

```
$ apt install redis-server
```

Then the test suite can be run via Go's generic testing framework:

```
$ go test -v -race -cover ./...
...
```

## Suricata settings

The tool is designed to consume JSON events from a socket, by default `/tmp/suri.sock`. This can be enabled using the following setting in `suricata.yaml`:
```yaml
...
# Extensible Event Format (nicknamed EVE) event log in JSON format
- eve-log:
    enabled: yes
    filetype: unix_stream
    filename: /tmp/suri.sock
    ...
```
All JSON is also passed through to another socket, which allows to plug it between Suricata and another log consumer, e.g. Logstash and friends.

Another way to consume events is via Redis. Use the `-r` parameters to specify a Redis host, the key `suricata` will be queried as a list to BRPOP events from.

## Important settings

- Database connection: use the `-db-*` parameters to specify a database connection. PostgreSQL 9.5 or later is required. Use `-m` to use the parameters as MongoDB connection parameters instead.
- Chunk size: determines the number of events that is imported as a whole at the same time. Larger values may be faster and lead to better throughput, but will use more RAM and also lose more events in case a bulk import (=transaction) fails. Smaller values will increase the overhead on the database.
- Profiling: optional output of a pprof file to be used with `go tool pprof`.
- Table rotation: tables are created as unlogged tables without indexes for maximal write performance. To keep table sizes in check, tables are timestamped and rotated in a time interval chosen by the user, e.g. 1h. Index creation is deferred until a table is rotated away and no longer written to, and also happens in the background. Indexing jobs are queued so if indexing takes longer than one rotation period, data should not be lost.
- Event forwarding: Events processed by FEVER can be forwarded to another socket to be processed by a downstream tool, e.g. Logstash. By default, only `alert` and `stats` event types are forwarded, but the set of forwarded types can be extended using `-t <type>` for each additional type to be forwarded. As a catch-all (and probably the best option for sensors still running a full ELK stack) the option `-T` will forward everything.
- Bloom filters can be reloaded by sending a `SIGUSR1` to the main process.

## Development test runs with local data

Create local socket to consume forwarded events. You can also use [pv](http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml) to monitor if data is flowing and how much (you may need to install the necessary tools using `apt install pv netcat-openbsd` before):

```bash
$ nc -klU /tmp/suri-forward.sock | pv > /dev/null
```

Instead of simply sending it to `/dev/null`, one can of course filter the output using `jq` etc. to visually confirm that certain output is forwarded.

Start the service:

```bash
$ ./fever run -v -n 0 -l '' &
```
The `-n 0` option disables submission of flow metadata. Optionally, `--dummy`/`--nodb` can be used to disable database inserts and only test input parsing and metadata aggregation.

Finally, push test data into the input socket:

```bash
$ head -n 100000 huge.eve.json | socat /tmp/suri.sock STDIO
```
which would feed the first 100k events from `huge.eve.json` into the socket. The `socat` tool can be installed as usual via `apt install socat`.

To feed EVE data into FEVER using Redis (started with `-r`), you can simply LPUSH the JSON events into a list referenced by the key `suricata`. Use the Lua script `scripts/makelpush` to convert raw EVE lines into Redis statements:

```
$ head -n 100000 huge.eve.json | scripts/makelpush | redis-cli > /dev/null
```
